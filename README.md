octovagrant
===========

Some helpful files when using octohost with Vagrant.

    # Install Docker Mac binary
    brew tap homebrew/binary
    brew install docker
    brew install direnv # More info here: https://github.com/zimbatm/direnv


NOTE: If you are using Vagrant 1.6+, the Vagrantfile will work without modification. If you're using < 1.6 then you can find the necessary URL at [Vagrant Cloud](https://vagrantcloud.com/darron/octohost/versions).

There are two ways to proceed from here:

### Use the already built Vagrant box.

    vagrant up # The box will be downloaded, verified and installed.
    vagrant ssh -c "curl -L https://github.com/{your-username}.keys >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    cat ~/.ssh/{your-key.pub} | ssh vagrant@server.octodev.io "sudo gitreceive upload-key {your-name}"
    git clone https://github.com/octohost/harp.git && cd harp
    git remote add octo git@server.octodev.io:harp-test.git
    git push octo master
    lynx http://harp-test.octodev.io
    
### Use the already built Vagrant box from windows (using putty, and git)

    vagrant up # The box will be downloaded, verified and installed.
    vagrant ssh -c "curl https://github.com/{your-username}.keys >> /home/vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    plink vagrant@server.octodev.io # accept the server key and then Ctrl+C
    cat c:/Users/{you}/.ssh/{your-key.pub} | plink vagrant@server.octodev.io "sudo gitreceive upload-key {your-name}"
    set GIT_SSH=c:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY\plink.exe
    #
    # This point onward is just testing everything is working....
    #
    git clone https://github.com/octohost/harp.git && cd harp
    git remote add octo git@server.octodev.io:harp-test.git
    # you may find your putty is in a different folder
    git push octo master
    # open a browser to http://harp-test.octodev.io
    
    
### Build your own box using Chef.

Once you have your octohost built and the box installed using [these instructions](https://github.com/octohost/octohost-cookbook)

#### Once you've built it.

Then you can cd into this directory:

    [] darron@~/Dropbox/src: cd octovagrant/
    .envrc is blocked from loading. Run `direnv allow` to approve it's content for loading.
    [] darron@~/Dropbox/src/octovagrant: direnv allow
    direnv: reloading
    direnv: loading .envrc
    direnv export: ~DOCKER_HOST
    [] darron@~/Dropbox/src/octovagrant: vagrant up

This is in the spirit of [dvm](https://github.com/fnichol/dvm) - which is docker without the octohost web focus.

You should be able to use both dvm and [octohost](https://github.com/octohost/octohost) using these instructions.
